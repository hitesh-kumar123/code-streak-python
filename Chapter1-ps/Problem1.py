I was in a sheer dress the day that we met
We were both in a rush, we talked for a sec
Your friend hit me up so we could connect
And what are the odds? You send me a text
And now the next thing I know, I'm like
Manifest that you're oversized
I digress, got me scrollin' like
Out of breath, got me goin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh (Ah)
Who's the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent? Like
Ooh (Ah)
Maybe it's all in my head

[Chorus]
But I bеt we'd have really good bеd chem
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round
Oh, it just makes sense
How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things
That's bed (Bed) chem (Chem)
How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed
Are you free next week?
I bet we'd have really good
      [Verse 2]
Come right on me, I mean camaraderie
Said you're not in my timezone, but you wanna be
Where art thou? Why not uponeth me?
See it in my mind, let's fulfill the prophecy

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh (Ah)
Who's the cute guy with the wide, blue eyes and the big bad mm? Like
Ooh (Ah)
I know I sound a bit redundant

[Chorus]
But I bet we'd have really good bed chem
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round
Oh, it just makes sense (Oh, it just makes sense)
How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things (Bad)
That's bed chem (Oh, that's bed chem)
How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed (So obsessed)
Are you free next week?
I bet we'd have really good (Bed chem)

[Bridge]
And I bet we'd both arrive at the same time (Bed chem)
And I bet the thermostat's set at six-nine (Bed-bed ch-chem)
And I bet it's even better than in my head (My)
